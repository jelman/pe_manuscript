Scripts to calculate practice and attrition effects. Examines tests comprising cognitive domains as well as AFQT.

Longitudinal subjects, attriters and attrition replacements are assessed for group differences. Practice effects are examined before and after adjusting for any differences in potentially important measures. 

The manuscript repo contains additional analyses not present in the VETSA general use repo. These include:
- Executive measures adjusted for processing speed.
- Creation of cognitive domains.
- Analysis of change before and after practice effect adjustment.
- Supplemental analyses to test for effects of age and duration.
